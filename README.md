# Intro-to-Graphs-Python-
The aim of this graph is to find the shortest route and route around the city 
This project implements a graph data structure and algorithms in Python to find routes between cities. It focuses on:

Creating a Graph:
Represents a city network as a graph using a dictionary to store connections between cities (start: [connected_cities]).
Finding All Paths:
Implements a recursive function get_paths to explore all possible routes between a starting and ending city, avoiding revisiting cities.
Finding the Shortest Path:
Implements a recursive function get_shortest_path to discover the route with the fewest connections between two cities.
Running the Script:

Save the code: Create a Python file (e.g., graph.py) and paste the provided code.
Execute the script: Open a terminal in the project directory and run python graph.py.
